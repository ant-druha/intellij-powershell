The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased] (2.7.0)
### Changed
- Update PowerShellEditorServices from v3.18.1 to v3.20.1
- Update junixsocket from v2.9.0 to v2.9.1

## [2.6.1] - 2024-03-28
### Fixed
- [#257](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/pull/257): pass `-NoProfile` to PowerShell when detecting its version, to determine the version faster and avoid possible problems caused by shell customizations

  Thanks to @En3Tho for the contribution.
- [#259](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/pull/259): additionally, pass `-NonInteractive` argument

## [2.6.0] - 2024-03-24
### Changed
- **Requirement update!** If you set the plugin to use PowerShell (aka PowerShell Core, as opposed to Windows PowerShell), then PowerShell 7.2.11 is the minimal supported version

  The requirements related to Windows PowerShell version are not changed.
- [#22](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/22): the default working directory for a newly created **PowerShell** run configuration is now the script's parent directory

  Configurations created by previous versions of the plugin are unchanged.
- [#176: Migrate to PowerShell Core by default](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/176)

  If available on the target system, the modern PowerShell will be used be default, if available. Note that only new plugin installations will be affected, due to how we store the plugin settings. If the plugin is already installed, then it will use the previously discovered PowerShell instance.

  This is a Windows-only change, because only on Windows there are two PowerShell versions that may coexist.
- [#229](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/229): the **PowerShell** run configuration will now save all the files before executing

  This fixes the cases when the started configuration wasn't using the latest version of an edited script file.
- [#51: Update PowerShellEditorServices](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/51) to v3.18.1
- PSScriptAnalyzer has been updated to the latest v1.22.0

### Removed
- The plugin no longer bundles Plaster that was a part of an older PowerShellEditorServices distribution, even though it wasn't used by the plugin.

## [2.5.0] - 2024-03-12
### Fixed
- [#67](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/67): An attribute block before function's `param` could lead to incorrect indentation
- [#102](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/102): Formatter breaking the code around unary operators such as `-Not` and equal signs in command-line arguments
- [#183: Redundant multi line comment closing sequence added when user adds newline](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/183)
- [#138: Run configuration template doesn't work](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/138)

### Added
- [#184](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/184): Support the null-coalescing operator

### Changed
- [LSP4J](https://github.com/eclipse-lsp4j/lsp4j) library has been updated to v0.3.1
- [junixsocket](https://github.com/kohlschutter/junixsocket) has been updated to 2.9.0

## [2.4.0] - 2024-03-09
### Changed
- The lexer and parser were migrated to be auto-generated by the Gradle Grammar-Kit task

  We do not expect any changes, but they may happen, so please report any cases of suspicious plugin behavior.

### Fixed
- [#79: Can't detect PowerShell version on Linux](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/79)

  Thanks to @8ru73u5 for investigation of the issue.

  This problem was caused by [the PowerShell issue #11747](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11747).
- A bit more of IO work during language server connection moved to the corresponding threads

  This should save some IDE responsibility in rare cases when it could be a problem.
- Increased timeout on connecting to the language server; should fix issues on slower computers
- [#42: The run configuration now uses terminal encoding](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/42) (UTF-8 by default)
- [#17: When the username has a space, the plugin fails to initialize](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/17)

## [2.3.1] - 2023-12-30
### Fixed

- [#160](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/160): the `exit` keyword is now allowed in more positions in the parser
- [#166](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/166): "Slow operations are prohibited on EDT" report about disk IO on run configuration startup
- [#154](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/154): Input not properly processed in the run configuration
### Changed
- The **PowerShell** run configuration no longer ignores certain kinds of internal exceptions; they will be properly reported

## [2.3.0] - 2023-10-29
### Changed
- The PowerShellEditorServices connection code has been refactored to not cause any UI freezes: everything was moved to background and rewritten to use non-blocking IO as much as possible

### Fixed
- [#155](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/155): cannot start PowerShellEditorServices under the default PowerShell 5 execution policy, `Restricted`
