## [Unreleased]
### Fixed

## [2.4.0] - 2024-03-09
### Changed
- The lexer and parser were migrated to be auto-generated by the Gradle Grammar-Kit task

  We do not expect any changes, but they may happen, so please report any cases of suspicious plugin behavior.

### Fixed
- [#79: Can't detect PowerShell version on Linux](https://github.com/ant-druha/intellij-powershell/issues/79)

  Thanks to @8ru73u5 for investigation of the issue.

  This should save some IDE responsibility in rare cases when it could be a problem.

## [2.3.0] - 2023-10-29
